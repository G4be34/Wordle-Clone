## What is Wordle-Clone?

Wordle-Clone is a clone of the popular Wordle game. It is a simple word-guessing game that allows users to type in letters of any 5-letter word to guess the 'target' word. The goal of the game is to guess the 'target' word within 6 tries by receiving hints on which letters are correct based on 5-letter words you type in. 

## When to Use Wordle-Clone

Wordle-Clone is a great game for anyone looking for a fun and challenging word game. It can be used for casual fun or as a way to improve vocabulary and spelling. It is also perfect for those looking for a way to pass the time.

## Challenges Faced

One of the biggest challenges faced when creating Wordle-Clone was finding a way to store the user's progress. The game needed to be able to store the user's progress so they could pick up where they left off. To solve this problem, I decided to use MongoDB and Amazon AWS.

Another challenge was creating the user interface. I wanted to make sure that the game was easy to use and understand. To accomplish this, I used React to create a simple and intuitive user interface.

## Wins and Improvements

Wordle-Clone was able to successfully create a clone of the popular Wordle game. I was able to use technologies such as MongoDB, Amazon AWS, React, Express.js, Node.js, HTML, and CSS with Styled-Components to create a user-friendly interface and store the user's progress.

I could improve the game by adding more levels and difficulty settings as well as the ability to change the size of the word to guess. We could also add a leaderboard so users can compare their scores with others.
